                    <img src="assets/images/Profile pic.jpg" alt="Jennifer Ginelli">
                    <p>After graduating with honors from Syracuse University with a dual degree in Advertising and Anthropology, Jennifer started her career in Market Research. Studying commercial effectiveness at the well-established Millward Brown International, she worked on a range of products from Minute Maid Orange Juice to Snuggle Fabric Softener.  From there, she went on to strengthen her research skills at the boutique Market Research firm, Newman Stein, in New York City.</p>
                    <p>But, the world of Advertising called to Jennifer and her unique skill set. She began working at BBDO Worldwide on Campbell Soup, the U.S. Navy and Armstrong Flooring. Conducting tracking and advertising development research to better connect with consumers.  
                        Traditional research gave way to the discipline of Strategic Planning -- which focuses guiding the brand message not just measuring if it is being received. And Jennifer made the exciting move to the Strategic Planning team at the historic agency, Bates Worldwide. Founded by legendary Adman, Ted Bates, and famous for establishing the “USP” – a brand’s Unique Selling Proposition. Bates was an ideal environment for Jennifer to develop her consumer insight techniques.  And this work helped Brands like Wendy’s, CVS and Lipitor thrive.  Energized by the unique challenges of new business, Jennifer rose through the ranks to Senior Vice President.</p>
                    <p>New challenges (Motherhood) led away from agency life in New York. And Jennifer was able to explore additional creative pursuits: writing, drawing and graphic design.  Birthdays and Holidays were an opportunity to unleash creative energies, like her “new business” days.  These over-the -top events gave way to her “Party Momster” Blog that chronicled ways to be “the life of the party at home.”</p>
                    <p>Infusing energy into projects is Jennifer’s specialty. She recently broke fundraising goals for her local Elementary School’s Spring Fair which she Chaired. And through her marketing management, HD Indoor Storage, an indoor RV storage facility, achieved 100% occupancy within its first year.</p>
